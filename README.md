# GoPhish Notifier

GoPhish Notifier notifies red team members when their GoPhish campaign status
has been updated. It supports both Slack and Email notification profiles by
default, but it's very extensible so new notification profiles can be added
easily.

## Note

This fork is intended to be compatible with a modified version (IOCs removed) of GoPhish available at [evilgophish](https://github.com/fin3ss3g0d/evilgophish).

If you are using vanilla GoPhish, revert the signature header to `X-Gophish-Signature` in [main.go](main.go).

## Installation

### From Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/t94j0/gophish-webhook-slack
cd gophish-webhook-slack
go build -o phishbot
```
